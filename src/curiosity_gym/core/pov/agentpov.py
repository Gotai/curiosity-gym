"""Definitions for inputs and outputs of the curiosity-gym grid environments.

This module defines point-of-view classes that implement the processing of 
inputs going into a grid environment (actions) and outputs coming out of a
grid environment (observations). By default, there are three distinct pov
classes. The GlobalView always returns the full state of an environment.
The observation of LocalView only contains grid cells that are inside a
given radius of the agent. The ForwardView only contains grid cells that
are in front of the agent within a field of given width and length. 
LocalView and ForwardView only provide information about a cell if there 
is no wall or closed door between the agent and the particular cell.
