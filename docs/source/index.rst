The framework provides three predefined Gymnasium environments, each of which has been designed to address a specific goal of curiosity-driven approaches. In addition to its focus on the distinctive characteristics of curiosity-driven RL, Curiosity Gym emphasizes usability and flexibility, making it an accessible tool for both researchers and practitioners in the field.
